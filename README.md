 ## My Skills
Learning python really gave me an edge for learning machine learning and data science. I was able to learn and understand the code well. I also learned various other programming languages such as "R" which were really important in order to become a machine learning engineer or a data scientist. Below are the list of some of my skills that I've gained throughout my experience of working with data science and machine learning.
